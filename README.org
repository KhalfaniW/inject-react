* Goal
 Organize youtube reccomendations to 
    + reduce randomness
      + Reduce slot machine style randomness
        Don't make it random and boring(loss) until new good video pops up (win)
      + Convert it into a reddit/news style
        1 new set of random videos in the day 
    + Elimate reccomended vidos that you *do not want to watch* until you are too bored to resits
    + eliminate reshowing the same things as if they were new
       (show same video in 4th-5th position untiil you click it)
* How  
   + Every new relaoad show only difference between last times 
     * Add counter to every show
   + hide thumbnails unless requested to reduce imformation overload and stess
   + Hide reccomendations that you don't want to watch (opt in to show)
   + Segregate new reccomendations
